# xai-experiments

This repositorie is responsible to make experiments with explainable artificial inteligence on human activity recognition context.

We'll apply xai thecniques in machine learning models that are use to human activity recognition.

Some examples of xai thecniques:

- LIME
- SHAP
- LASTS
